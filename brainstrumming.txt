Shitty topic I know
Ok what can you do


 - There is no need to be perfect
 - No need to do your best
 - Savestates such as in a gameboy
 - 
You have one savestate
	you have ONE savestate


 + Like the idea
 - platformer ? :(
 + Dialogue

It can also be methaphorical just lik being stuck in a daily routine
  ++ I like the daily routine stuff
  - Drawing a whole ass city wtf how can you have such unrealitic expectations of yourself

 ++ Trains
	Trains are stuck in a loop
	I like trains
	They are also not a stupid platformer



Think gaemplay things

 level is a loop
 

 loop through time 
 loop through space
 loop throug same situations

no need to do your best + trains
 I mean you could do something like a train manager with a savestate, but I believe not doing your best in that situation is not acceptable
Or maybe it is, if instead of doing it with trains killing people you do it with time


Youkai?? train
 You are a youkai that can turn back time, you are also the main conductor of the youkai train, you use your power to get the train in time
 But as you use your power you start feeling worst and worst finally you colapse and you lose control of the train
  
   Do your best, but don't over do it. Everyone will be waiting for you :)


Ok now do it without trains


You have a ramen stall
 same thing
 gameplay has a worst compatibility with me

what happens if the player actually does not do it's best?????
 - You get a message saying that you overdid anyway
 - You get the bullshits early on

 they drop messages


--------------------------Stylessssss

Sells:
 - Ramen
 - Software?
 - Drinks
 - Coffe

On a:
 - Moving Stall
 - Bar

to:
 - People
 - Gods 
 - Youkai



Food + Youkai does make for a there is more to the world than you know
 but it also makes it a bit goofy

youkai does explain the items disappearing and the power to turn back time

I like the image of the ramen stall more than the bar

Could it be that I built the entire premise of the game basing it on me being able to write??
what the hell, why would you do this, you have written nothing in your entire life




Level 1:
 - Introduction 
	-Tutorial (can't fail)

 - (you can use the power you know? | you start feeeling the routine)
 	- Level 2
 - Bad news
	- Level 3
 - You feel exhausted 
	- Level 4
 - End
